# Ecommerce Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project analyzes customer behavior in an online retail setting using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. The goal is to identify customer segments to enhance marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

## Overview
- **Dataset**: Online retail sales data
- **Techniques Used**: Data cleaning, RFM analysis, customer segmentation, data visualization

## Conclusion and Insights

### Summary of Findings

- **Cluster 0**: This group of **3,221 customers** is doing pretty well! They’ve made about **4.7 purchases** on average in the last **41 days**, spending roughly **£1,547.89** each. These customers are active and likely appreciate our products, so let’s keep them happy!

- **Cluster 1**: Here we have **1,094 customers** who haven’t shopped with us in a while, averaging **246 days** since their last purchase. They only make about **1.58 purchases** and spend around **£413.72**. We might need to remind them why they loved us in the first place!

- **Cluster 2**: This is our elite squad, consisting of just **23 customers**. They’ve been super active, with **71.26 purchases** and spending a whopping **£38,534.01** on average! They really love what we offer, so we should definitely make them feel special.

### Business Implications

Understanding these segments can really help us tailor our marketing strategies:

- **For Cluster 0**: Let’s show our appreciation with loyalty programs or personalized promotions. Keeping them engaged is key!

- **For Cluster 1**: We should consider some re-engagement campaigns—maybe send them special offers or reminders about new products. A little nudge might bring them back!

- **For Cluster 2**: We need to roll out the red carpet for these high-value customers. Exclusive rewards or a personal touch in our outreach can help maintain their loyalty.

### Recommendations

Here are some practical steps we can take moving forward:

- **Personalized Marketing Campaigns**: Let’s create targeted email campaigns for each cluster. For Cluster 0, think loyalty rewards; for Cluster 1, some enticing re-engagement offers.

- **Customer Retention Strategies**: Implement special programs for our Cluster 2 VIPs. Early access to new products or exclusive perks will show them how much we value their business.

- **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: It’s essential to keep an eye on these segments over time. Customer behaviors can change, so we’ll need to adjust our strategies accordingly to keep everyone engaged.
